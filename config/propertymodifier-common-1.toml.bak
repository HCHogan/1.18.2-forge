#Any invalid entries will result in a log warning, but will just be skipped, and working entries will work.
#Most entries will utilize a block, item or enchantment id, which needs to be in the modid:blockid, modid:itemid or modid:enchantmentid format, respectively. "minecraft:" is not optional.
#All of these support regex. So you could use .* to select all entries, or minecraft:.* to select all elements in the minecraft namespace. For further information, please consult Google.
#Entries are read from left to right, this means that entries will overwrite entries read before it if they modify the same block/item/enchantment.
#NBT and blockstates are currently not supported in any way.
